Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.
Writing the code
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code

what is class?
A.
Class is a blueprint of an object

What is object?
A.
Object is an instance of a class

What is the entry point of an application?
A.
The main() method

Why main is static?
A.
Main has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without
creating an object of the class in which the main method is defined. If we omit static keyword before main Java
program will successfully compile but it won't execute.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.
java.lang.Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.
Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.
Difference between the two is that interface cannot declare a body, methods remain abstract, and abstract must have a body implemented, non abstract menthod.
  
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.
No
what is Access Specifier?
A.
Regulator of access to classes,fields and methods. The Specifier determines whether a field or method in a class,
can be used or invoked by another method in another class or sub-class. Access Specifiers can
be used to restrict access.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.
Object Oriented Programming, it's features are inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.
java.lang

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.
Application programming interface
CNN API
TestNG API

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.
Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to diamond problem.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.
Method overloading means providing two or more separate methods in a class with the same name but different arguments

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

It is handled using "Try" "Catch"

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.
Static keyword is used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.
Final is a keyword that defines an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command. All methods in a final class are implicitly final.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.
Final is a keyword.	Finally is a block.	Finalize is a method.

What is a constructor ?
A. Block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created (Same name, same class)

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.
Yes

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.
the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.
THIS is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.
super refer to the super class the current class is extends to
we can use the super constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.
java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.
No

What version of java are you using?
A.
8
My "Java -version" output:
java version "1.8.0_201"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_201-b09)

What is JAR stand for ?
A.
java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.
JDK is a toolkit and JVM is part of JDK

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.
JRE is the environment where JVM runs.

What is compile time and run time?
A.
compile time is the time it tale to compile the source code.
When a program is running, or executing, it is said to be in runtime.

What is heap?
A. The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated

How java manage it's memory?
A.
Java stores objects in the heap, then they are created when the JVM starts and may increase or decrease  in size while the application runs.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.
String is immutable object. String is stored in the Constant String Pool
StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap
StringBuilder is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified .
The main difference between the StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuilder is also not thread safe. StringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe .

What is Singleton class?
A.
In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.
Serialization converts objects into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a database or sent through streams.
 Deserialization  is the reverse process of creating objects from sequence of bytes.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.
It's used in serialization, and if you classify data members as transient, it will not be serialized.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.
while loop executes the content of the loop once before checking the condition of the while.
while loop will check the condition first before executing the content.

What is Enum?
A.
Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants, methods etc

What is Iterator?
A.
Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.
int is a data type and integer is a class, therefore Integer takes more memory.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.
The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. Since cached String literals are shared between multiple clients there is always a risk, where one client's action would affect all another client

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.
Serial is for single-threaded environments, and Parallel Garbage Collector is used for multi-threaded environments.

What is JIT stands for?
A. Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space.
Garbage Collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that doesn’t have any reference. Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere of the application.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.
NO. It is possible to create objects that never go out of scope by mistake, thus consuming more and more memory until all heap is exhausted.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space.
Java Stack memory is used for execution of a thread. They contain method specific values that are short-lived and references to other objects in the heap that are getting referred from the method.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.
Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

what is multithreading in java?
A.
Multithreading executes multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of
processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading are used to achieve multitasking.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.
Synchronization in Java is an important concept since Java is a multi-threaded language where multiple threads run in parallel to complete program execution. In multi-threaded environment synchronization of Java object or synchronization of Java class becomes extremely important. Synchronization in Java is possible by using Java keywords "synchronized" and "volatile”.

What is Framework?
A.
Frameworks are large bodies of written code to which you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. jUnit and testNG

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.
jUnit supports the core concept of “first testing then coding”. This framework is specifically designed for Java programming language. In this, data is first tested and then it is inserted in the piece of code. It provides the simplest approach for writing code swiftly and easily.  It also offers annotation for test method identification.
testNG resembles JUnit but offers some new functionality to make it powerful and easier to use. it supports concurrent testing and offers annotation support as well.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.
testng,
java-json,
mongo-java-driver
mysql-connector

what is dependency injection in java?
A.
Dependency injection is called Inversion of Control. This concept a class should not configure its dependencies
statically but should be configured from the outside.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.
Dynamic Binding: In Dynamic binding compiler doesn’t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding.
Static Binding: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time .
